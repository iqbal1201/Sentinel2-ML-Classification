### Project Background: Sentinel-2 Imagery Classification
##### Overview
The increasing availability of satellite imagery offers an unprecedented opportunity for environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and urban planning. Sentinel-2, a mission within the Copernicus Programme, provides high-resolution optical imagery at various spectral bands, making it ideal for detailed Earth observation. This project leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to classify Sentinel-2 imagery into multiple land cover classes, enhancing our ability to analyze and interpret large-scale geographic data.

##### Objectives
Classify Land Cover Types: Develop a robust ML model to accurately classify Sentinel-2 imagery into multiple land cover types such as urban areas, water bodies, forests, agricultural lands, and barren lands.
Compare ML Models: Evaluate and compare the performance of various ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Enhance Accuracy: Identify the most effective model and fine-tune it to maximize classification accuracy and computational efficiency.


##### Significance
Accurate land cover classification is crucial for several reasons:

- Environmental Monitoring: Helps in tracking deforestation, urbanization, and changes in water bodies.
- Agricultural Management: Aids in crop monitoring, yield prediction, and management of agricultural resources.
- Urban Planning: Assists in urban development and infrastructure planning by providing detailed land use information.
- Disaster Management: Supports flood mapping, wildfire monitoring, and other disaster response activities.

##### Sentinel-2 Imagery
Sentinel-2 provides imagery at high spatial resolution (10m, 20m, and 60m) across 13 spectral bands, ranging from visible and near-infrared to shortwave infrared. This rich spectral information allows for detailed analysis and classification of various land cover types.

#### Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression: A simple, yet effective linear model often used as a baseline for classification tasks.
- Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to obtain a more accurate and stable prediction.
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): An advanced implementation of gradient boosting that is highly efficient and effective for classification problems.
- LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine): A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms, optimized for speed and efficiency.
- Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that works well for high-dimensional spaces and is effective in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.

#### Methodology
- Data Collection: Acquire Sentinel-2 imagery data for the area of interest.
- Preprocessing: Perform necessary preprocessing steps including atmospheric correction, cloud masking, and band selection.
- Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the spectral bands to represent different land cover types.
- Model Training: Train the selected ML models using labeled data (training set) and optimize hyperparameters.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models on a separate validation set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Comparison and Selection: Compare the performance of all models and select the best-performing one.
- Deployment: Deploy the final model for real-time land cover classification and generate classification maps.
